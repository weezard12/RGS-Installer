WPF application designed to simplify the process of installing and managing GitHub releases. Getting someone unfamiliar with GitHub to install a release of your project can be challenging. To solve this, I created this custom installer that leverages the GitHub API to install, uninstall, and update GitHub releases. By simply entering a GitHub username, the application fetches all of the releases of the user, making them ready to install with a single click.
## Features
- Simple and User-Friendly.
- Install, Uninstall GitHub releases.
- Upcoming: Updating installed releases.
- Upcoming: Way to install releases other than from my user.
## How To Download?
1. Download the `RGS.Installer.Console.exe` or `RGS.Installer.Console.Light.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/weezard12/RGS-Installer/releases/tag/rgs_installer).
2. Run `RGS Installer Console.exe` (the installed file) **as an Administrator**.
    - The reason for administrator privileges is because the console app will install the UI Installer in the `Program Files` folder, which is a folder that can't be accessed     without administrator privileges.
